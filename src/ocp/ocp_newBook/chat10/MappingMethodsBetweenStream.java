        return stream.mapToObj(x -> x);
    }
    private static Stream<Integer> boxing(IntStream stream) {
        return stream.boxed();

/*    The first one uses the mapToObj() method we saw earlier. The second one is more succinct.
    It does not require a mapping function because all it does is autobox each primitive to
    the corresponding wrapper object.
    The boxed() method exists on all three types of primitive streams.*/
