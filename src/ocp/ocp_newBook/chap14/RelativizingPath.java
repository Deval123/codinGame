         * ../../fish.txt
         * The idea is this: if you are pointed at a path in the file system, what steps would
         * you need to take to reach the other path? For example, to get to fish.txt from
         * friendly/birds.txt, you need to go up two levels (the file itself counts as one level)
         * and then select fish.txt.
         * If both path values are relative, the relativize() method computes the paths as if they
         * are in the same current working directory. Alternatively, if both path values are absolute, the
         * method computes the relative path from one absolute location to another, regardless of the
         * current working directory. The following example demonstrates this property when run on a
         * Windows computer:
