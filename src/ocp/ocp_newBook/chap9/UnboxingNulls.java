/*        On line 13, we add a null to the list. This is legal because a null reference can be assigned
        to any reference variable. On line 14, we try to unbox that null to an int primitive. This is a
        problem. Java tries to get the int value of null. Since calling any method on null gives a
        NullPointerException, that is just what we get. Be careful when you see null in relation to autoboxing.*/
